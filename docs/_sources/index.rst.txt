Welcome to Ormstorm's documentation!
====================================

ORMStorm is a small library for easy work with databases.


Features
########

* **Simplicity**: The library is very simple, and it won't take long to learn it.
* **Coding speed**: Integrating the library into your projects won't take long.
* **Dynamic**: Unlike others, this library will allow you to very quickly create new tables and add databases to them.


Simple usage
############

.. code-block:: python

   from ormstorm import Table, Types, Column, create_session


   class ExampleTable(Table):
       __tablename__ = "example"

       id = Column(Types.INTEGER, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True)
       text = Column(Types.STRING)


   LocalSession = create_session("example.sqlite3", [ExampleTable])

   with LocalSession() as session:
       session.insert(ExampleTable(text="Hello, world!"))
