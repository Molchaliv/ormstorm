Usage
#####

Magic filters were created to simplify the execution of SQL queries. The syntax is similar to what you write in conditions.

For example, if you want to select all columns where the ID is greater than 5 and not equal to 10, then you just need to write this:

.. code-block:: python

    ...

    with LocalSession() as session:
        result = session.select(
            YourTable.id > 5 & YourTable.id != 10
        )

As you can see, instead of the usual ``and``, the ``&`` operator is used. Also replaced ``or`` with ``|`` and ``not`` with ``~``.


All Operators
#############


For convenience, we have created a table that stores all currently supported operators.


.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 25
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Operator
     - Description
   * - ==
     - Equals

     - Not equal
   * - >=
     - Greater or equal
   * - >

     - Less or equal
   * - <
